                <h3 align="center" >We’ll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes,<br>
                But the plural of ox becomes oxen, not oxes.<br>
                One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese,<br>
                Yet the plural of moose should never be meese.<br>
                You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice,<br>
                Yet the plural of house is houses, not hice.

                <h3 align="center" ><u>If</u> the plural of man is always called men,<br>
                    Why shouldn’t the plural of pan be called pen?<br>
                    <u>If</u> I speak of my foot and show you my feet,<br>
                    And I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet?<br>
                    <u>If</u> one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth,<br>
                    Why shouldn’t the plural of booth be called beeth?<br>

                <h3 align="center" >Then one may be that, and three would be those,<br>
                    Yet hat in the plural would never be hose,<br>
                    And the plural of cat is cats, not cose.<br>
                    We speak of a brother and also of brethren,<br>
                    But though we say mother, we never say methren.<br>
                    Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him,<br>
                    <s>But imagine the feminine: she, shis and shim!</s><br>
